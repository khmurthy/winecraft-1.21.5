### Summary

Winecraft is a lightweight mod that aims to make Minecraft's food more engaging to work with. Gone are the days of steak being by far the most efficient source of food in the early game. With a little extra work, your wheat will stretch 3x as far, and complex foods like pumpkin pie are now worth the effort.

Future plans include a vanilla-friendly system for making cider, ale, mead, and berry wine. 

### Current Features

Each wheat can now be crafted into dough, which can be baked into bread. This makes the wheat-to-bread conversion three times more efficient, incentivizing baking bread over feeding it to your livestock.

Cooked meats including steak, mutton, rabbit, porkchop, chicken, and salmon have all had their nutrition and saturation values unified. They now all give 6 nutrition and 6 saturation, making them all equally viable early-to-midgame options.

Baked potatoes have had their nutrition value reduced from 5 to 4. This means it's no longer just a purely more efficient alternative to bread.

Pumpkin pie has had its saturation value increased.

Crafting recipes for cake, pumpkin pie, and cookies have all been changed to include baking.

### Recommended Mods

While not necessary, I would recommend you use [Bigger Stack Size](https://modrinth.com/datapack/bigger-stack-size) by Jodek and set the stack sizes for stews to 16. This mod doesn't interact at all with Winecraft, but it makes stews -- which are very high-effort foods -- more worth the trouble. In the future, I plan to incorporate larger stew stack sizes into Winecraft.

### Planned Features

- Drinks
  - Crafted by placing an ingredient and a bottle in a barrel, then sealing the barrel with wax and waiting. Multiple drinks can be crafted at a time, limited by either the number of ingredients or the number of bottles, whichever one is lower.
  - The ingredient used will determine which drink is made.
    - Apples -- Cider
    - Wheat -- Ale
    - Honey -- Mead (no extra bottles necessary)
    - Sweet Berries -- Sweet Berry Wine
    - Glow Berries -- Glow Berry Wine
- Stews
  - Crafted by combining vegetables, meat, and/or mushrooms in a bowl.
  - Expansion on the vanilla collection of stews, using real-world examples of culturally significant stews for reference.
  - Stackable to 16 for viability as a mid or late game food item.
